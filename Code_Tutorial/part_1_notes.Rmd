## What is a graph?

* Graphs are a collection of nodes and edges that can be used to store data
    + What are nodes?
        - They are also known as vertices and the two names are often used interchangeably 
        - A correlation to the english language would be nouns
        - Nodes often represent people, places, and things
        - Nodes can have attributes like names, types, color, or whatever you want to use to describe them
        - To continue with the metaphor, these attributes could be described as adjectives
    + What are edges?
        - They are also known as links and the two names are often used interchangeably
        - A correlation to the english language would be verbs
        - Edges often represent relationships:
            + Two people can **be friends**
            + A person can **purchase** something
            + A thing can **distributed** to different store locations
        - Edges can have attributes like:
            + a start date of a friendship. 
            + It could be a strong or weak friendships.
            + the amount of money spent on a purchase
            + whether there was haggling or not.
            + the number of items being distributed
            + the date of distribution
        - To continue with the metaphore, these attributes could be described as adjectives
        - Sometimes, these attributes can be represented as numeric weights and can be used in certain graph algorithms
        - There can be multiple edges between nodes
            + a person can be both a friend and a coworker with another person
            + a person can purchase an item multiple times at different prices
            + stores restock the same items often
        - Edges can have direction
            + you can follow someone who doesn't follow you back on twitter
            + semantically, a person **buys** something and this relationship can be showed with direction
            + A store can request a certain amount of items, but depending on the stock, a supplier might have to deliver a different amount
    + What are different graph models?
        - What I've been explaining up to now is called the Property Graph model
            + There is no limitation the the amount of information that can be stored in any given node or edge
            + Nodes can have multiple edges between them
            + Can be explained as an **entity-attribute-value** model
                + similar to JSON objects, Python dictionaries, or R lists where the name or index can hold a value
        - Another model is the Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph
            + Used in semantic web and is a family of world wide web consortium (w3c) specifications
            + The concept of triples is fundamental and can be described as using a **subject-predicate-object** model
                + Nodes only have one piece of information
                + Edges connect the information stored in nodes
            + The goal of RDF is to maximize searchability. If there is only one node that represents the concept of "Person", then we only need to find a single node and move outwords. The alternative would be to search every node for an attribute of 'Person'.
        - This workshop will mainly focus on property graphs, but as you continue to explore graphs on your own, you'll begin to see RDF in a lot of places.
* What are the benefits of using a graph for my data?
    + Social Network Analysis
        - A very common use case for graphs is social network analysis
            + This is useful for epidimiology
                - If we know who has a certain contagious disease, and if we know who they have come in contact with, then we can predict the likelihood of a person getting sick
            + Citation and collaboration analysis can be used to identify who are top performers in a particular academic field. It can also be used to identify sub-communities within a greater acdemic field. 
            + Social media has been used to identify similar people. This is useful for marketing because they can identify who information about a potential market. 
            + Once a group has been identified, you can get a better understanding of how they behave. NBC and the Mueller indictment released the Twitter handles of known Russian Twitter Trolls. Developers at neo4j analyzed this information and learned:
                - The trolls took up identities as either a typical american citizen, a local media outlet, or a local political perty.
                - There were only a handful of content creators and the a majority just retweeted in an attempt to amplify this message
                - Red is rightwing trolls, yellow is leftwing, purple is black lives matter
    + Recommendation Systems
        - Collaborative Filtering
            + Assumes that similar users are interested in the same things
            + User product interactions
        - Content based recommendations
            + Assumes if a user is interested in an object then the user will be interested in similar objects
            + Focuses on categorizing objects
        - Ebay; Amazon; Netflix
            + 35% of what consumers buy on amazon and 75% of what users watch on netflix comes from product recommendations
